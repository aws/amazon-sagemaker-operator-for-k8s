                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet

                deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by
                a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in
                this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers
                list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp
                is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future,
                although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior
                to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted
                in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination
                signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet
                will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
                after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
                partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until
                an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is
                fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has
                not been requested. \n Populated by the system when a graceful deletion
